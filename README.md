# ðŸ¤– Jarvis - A Chatbot Using Python & Tkinter

**Jarvis** is a simple, fun, and interactive chatbot created using Python's `Tkinter` GUI library. It can respond to user inputs with predefined conversational replies. The interface is colorful and engagingâ€”perfect as a beginner GUI project or mini-AI demo.

##  Features

- Graphical User Interface using Tkinter  
- Predefined responses for greetings, name, mood, time, and more  
- Displays real-time timestamp for user and bot messages  
- Simple logic with keyword-based response  
-  Vibrant and aesthetic hot-pink theme  
-  Friendly and cheerful bot personality


##  How It Works

- The GUI is created using `Tkinter`, with a chat display area, a user input box, and a send button.
- When a user sends a message, it is matched against predefined categories like:
  - greetings
  - name queries
  - mood questions
  - time-related questions
  - fallback for unknown input
- Jarvis picks a random response from each category to keep the chat varied.
